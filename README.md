# Driver Consistency Index & Championship Probability Model (Formula 1)
## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a data-driven model that quantifies driver consistency and estimates championship-winning probabilities using historical Formula 1 data.

## Motivation

Predicting long-term outcomes in Formula 1 is difficult due to regulation changes, driver transfers, and random race events. 
Instead of predicting a single winner, this project focuses on modeling uncertainty by analyzing historical performance trends of drivers and constructors.
